# robotframework-testscript-practice

Exercise task implemented with Robot Framework and Selenium library. The task was to create three test scripts against the "BrowserNotes" program:

1. A script that performs login and logout.
2. A script that creates a new "note" and verifies its content.
3. A script that creates a new user through the Django Administration tool and verifies that the user was created successfully.
